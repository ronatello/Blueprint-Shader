# Blueprint-Shader
This repository uses Cg (HLSL) shader programs and a Monogame (C#) driver program to showcase an application of Depth Peeling. Depth Peeling is combined with artistic edge filtering implementations to give a sketch-like quality. When the different layers are combined together, we obtain a blueprint-like render of the scene. 

An exercise has been created for the CPI 411 class to follow along and recreate the shader themselves, with explanations for the different code segments.
